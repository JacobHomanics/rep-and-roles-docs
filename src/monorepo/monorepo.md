## Mono Repository

The Mono Repository (MonoRepo) consists of several packages used to build, deploy, and interact with instances of Reputation & Roles.

The MonoRepo was forked from Buidl Guidl's [Scaffold Eth 2](https://scaffoldeth.io/), A modern Dapp framework with NextJS, RainbowKit, Wagmi and Typescript. Which supports Hardhat and Foundry.

### Foundry
The Foundry package makes use of Foundry, a toolkit for developing smart contracts, to develop, test, and deploy Reputation & Hats smart contracts. 

### NextJS
The NextJS package makes use of a NextJS project, which contains everything needed for a functional and hostable website that interacts with deployed instances of Reputation & Hats smart contracts.
